## Development

This work item handler was generated using the Maven archetype ``org.jbp.jbpm-workitems-archetype`` version ``7.74.1.Final``.

Requires JDK 11 â€” the ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable must point to a JDK 11 installation. For example, on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = 'C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.4'
```


## Functionality

Used as an example work item handler in the course "Healthcare Services Architectures".

It accepts as input the URL of an ``Appointment`` resource on an R5 FHIR server and returns the practitioner (doctor) and the patient for that appointment.

## Verification

For testing, an ``Appointment`` resource was created on the public HAPI FHIR test server: ``https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR5/Appointment/773551``. The file named ``Appointment`` in the repository contains a JSON representation of that resource.

The ``resources`` folder also includes several example resource representations in ``.json`` files to help run the exercise, plus a Docker Compose file to start an R5 FHIR server in a Docker container.

Running (with admin privileges) the following will start the server defined in the compose file and expose the FHIR endpoint at ``http://localhost:8888/fhir``:

```powershell
docker compose up -d
```

## Proposed exercise

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the fork locally.
3. Start an R5 FHIR server on your machine using the provided Docker Compose file.
4. Create the resources referenced by the provided ``Appointment.json`` (located in the tests `resources` folder). That folder contains example JSON representations of the resources to help you; after creating the resources on your server, replace the example JSON files with the actual representations returned by your server.
5. Create the ``Appointment`` resource (and replace ``Appointment.json`` with the representation obtained from your server).
6. Modify the unit test so that it uses your local server instead of the public HAPI FHIR server.
7. Run the tests and make any necessary fixes until they pass.
8. Tag a new release called ``EntregaP2`` and push it to your GitHub fork.
